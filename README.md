# TinyTyper
TinyTyper is a wireless auto-typing keyboard built with an ESP32-S3. This project allows you to send text from a web interface to the ESP32, which then types it out like a real keyboard! It includes human-like typing simulation with random delays, pauses, and even backspaces to mimic natural typing.
