TinyTyper: Wireless Auto-Typing Keyboard using ESP32 ðŸš€
TinyTyper is a wireless auto-typing keyboard built with an ESP32-S3. This project allows you to send text from a web interface to the ESP32, which then types it out like a real keyboard! It includes human-like typing simulation with random delays, pauses, and even backspaces to mimic natural typing.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
âœ… Turns ESP32-S3 into a USB HID keyboard
âœ… Built-in Wi-Fi hotspot with a web-based interface
âœ… Realistic typing with delays, pauses, and backspaces
âœ… Pause/Resume/Stop controls for typing flexibility
âœ… Uses FreeRTOS for multitasking

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
ESP32 creates a Wi-Fi hotspot (TinyTyper).

A web interface allows users to input text.

The text is sent to the ESP32, which simulates typing via USB HID.

Supports pause, resume, and stop commands.

ðŸ”¹ Requirements:
ESP32-S3 (with native USB support)

Arduino IDE / PlatformIO

USBHID and WebServer libraries

ðŸ”¹ Getting Started:
Flash the provided code onto your ESP32-S3.

Connect to the TinyTyper Wi-Fi network.

Open the web interface (192.168.4.1) and enter text.

Watch your ESP32 type automatically!
